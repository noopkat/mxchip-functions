# Functions for MXCHIP

Some experimental fun

## How to run

1. Pull down this repo
2. Ensure you have Azure Functions CLI installed
3. Add any local settings you need (WebJobs storage etc)
3. Run `func host start` in this repo's directory (don't forget to add CORS flags or settings properties if you need overrides for other local apps to access)

or alternatively, deploy this to Azure Functions in the cloud.
